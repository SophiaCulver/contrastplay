Contrast: The platformer where the level hides in plain sight.

The game’s main mechanic is its colors. Right now, the background is white, and the black platforms ahead of the player stick out from the background. 

When you press a key, you can change swap the background color. Platforms that bend in to the background color disappear from the level, and we just and can pass right through them!

This results in an interesting playstyle where the player has to manage the background color so they can progress. 

These gray platforms will remain in the level regardless of the background color, so you don’t have to worry about the floor disappearing when you swap on them. It’s like a safe zone. 

This mechanic results in action-filled platforming, switching colors mid-jump and swapping quickly to get through colored holes in the floor.
